## Project Overview

This project focuses on using **Multimeters** to measure internal resistance and voltage in different circuit configurations. The experiment aims to explore the proper use of digital multimeters for measuring voltage and resistance, and to understand how internal resistance affects measurement accuracy.

## Key Components

### 1. Measuring Internal Resistance of a Voltmeter
The experiment starts by examining the internal resistance of a voltmeter when placed in parallel with a circuit branch.
   - The goal is to observe how the internal resistance of the voltmeter affects the voltage measurements and to calculate the internal resistance based on the circuit configuration.

### 2. Connecting Two Multimeters
Two multimeters are connected, one in voltmeter mode and the other in ohmmeter mode, to measure internal resistance.
   - The experiment explores how different configurations of the multimeters affect the readings and aims to validate the internal resistance values obtained.

### 3. Simulating Voltage Measurements
The project involves simulating the behavior of a multimeter when connected to a resistor (R8) in parallel.
   - The experiment calculates the minimum internal resistance needed to keep the measurement error below 5%. This part includes both theoretical calculations and simulation results.

## Deliverables
- Circuit diagrams showing the multimeter configurations for measuring internal resistance and voltage.
- Calculations of internal resistance and measurement error, including a comparison of theoretical and simulation results.
- Screenshots of the multimeter settings and measured values for each part of the experiment.

This project is part of the **Digital Logic Design** course at the University of Tehran.
