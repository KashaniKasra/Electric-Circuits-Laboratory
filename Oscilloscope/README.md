## Project Overview

This project focuses on learning how to use an **Oscilloscope** for waveform measurement and triggering. The goal is to understand the functionality of oscilloscopes, particularly in handling external triggers, and to practice using different trigger modes and waveform generators.

## Key Components

### 1. Using the Oscilloscope with Function Generators
The experiment involves setting up two function generators in a simulation tool, with one connected to channel 2 of the oscilloscope and the other to the external trigger input.
   - The goal is to configure the oscilloscope to display stable waveforms by setting the correct trigger mode, frequency, and waveform types for the function generators.

### 2. Trigger Mode Configuration
The trigger mode is initially set to **Auto**, with the source set to **External** and the type set to **Edge**.
   - A triangular waveform is applied to channel 2 with specific amplitude, offset, and frequency values, and a sinusoidal waveform is used for external triggering.

### 3. Waveform Stability and Triggering
The experiment focuses on achieving a stable display of the waveform on the oscilloscope by fine-tuning the settings of the function generators and the trigger mode.
   - Different trigger modes (**Auto** and **Normal**) are explored to understand how they affect waveform display.

### 4. Understanding Trigger Levels
The trigger level is adjusted in steps to observe how the waveform behaves on the oscilloscope display.
   - The effects of setting the trigger level to different voltages, including zero and positive/negative levels, are analyzed.

### 5. Simulation and Measurements
The oscilloscope is used to observe the waveforms generated by the function generators. The results are recorded and analyzed.
   - The differences between trigger modes and how they affect the stability of the waveform are explored in detail.

## Deliverables
- Circuit diagrams and screenshots showing the setup of the oscilloscope and function generators.
- Observations on waveform behavior at different trigger levels and modes.
- A final report summarizing the effects of external triggers and trigger modes on waveform stability.
