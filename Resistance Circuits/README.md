## Project Overview

This project focuses on studying **Resistive Circuits** to understand concepts such as maximum power transfer, Thevenin equivalent circuits, and the superposition theorem. The goal is to simulate resistive networks, calculate power transfer, and validate theoretical concepts using simulation tools.

## Key Components

### 1. Maximum Power Transfer Theorem
The experiment starts by simulating a resistive network and calculating the Thevenin resistance \(R_{th}\).
   - A resistor is connected as a load, and the value of \(R_L\) is varied to achieve maximum power transfer. The power delivered to the load is plotted as a function of \(R_L\).

### 2. Thevenin Equivalent Circuit
Using simulation tools, the Thevenin resistance \(R_{th}\) is measured by disconnecting the load and observing the open-circuit voltage.
   - The experiment validates the relationship between the measured Thevenin resistance and the power delivered to the load when maximum power transfer occurs.

### 3. Superposition Theorem
A circuit with multiple voltage sources is simulated, and the superposition theorem is applied to determine the current through and the voltage across resistors when one voltage source is turned off at a time.
   - The results of the superposition theorem are compared with the results obtained from the combined circuit.

## Deliverables
- Simulated plots showing the power transfer curve and the relationship between \(R_L\) and power.
- Thevenin equivalent circuit analysis results and verification through simulation.
- Verification of the superposition theorem with simulation and comparison to theoretical results.

This project is part of the **Digital Logic Design** course at the University of Tehran.
