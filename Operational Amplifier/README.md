## Project Overview

This project focuses on studying the behavior of **Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps)**. The goal is to understand the design and functionality of circuits using op-amps, such as inverting amplifiers, summing amplifiers, and buffer circuits. The experiments involve simulating and analyzing the performance of these circuits using theoretical and practical approaches.

## Key Components

### 1. Inverting Amplifier
The first experiment involves designing and simulating an inverting amplifier circuit with specified resistances. The gain of the amplifier is calculated based on the resistor values.
   - Voltage measurements are taken at various nodes, and the output voltage is compared with theoretical calculations.

### 2. Summing Amplifier
The summing amplifier is designed to add multiple input voltages and provide a weighted sum as the output.
   - Theoretical and simulated output voltages are compared, and adjustments are made to ensure proper operation. Resistor values are adjusted to optimize performance.

### 3. Buffer Circuit
A buffer circuit is designed to prevent loading effects in a system, ensuring that the input and output voltages are maintained.
   - The buffer's effect on the circuit is analyzed by observing the voltage across a load resistor before and after introducing the buffer.

## Additional Experiments
- **Voltage Measurements**: Voltages across different nodes in the circuit are measured using a multimeter or software probes. The results are compared with theoretical predictions.
- **Load Resistance Impact**: The impact of different load resistances on the output voltage is studied, especially when using buffer circuits.
- **Simulations**: All circuits are simulated using software such as Multisim, and the results are analyzed for accuracy against theoretical values.

## Deliverables
- Circuit diagrams for each experiment.
- Voltage measurements and comparisons between theoretical and simulated results.
- A final report summarizing the performance of the operational amplifier circuits and the role of the buffer in maintaining voltage stability.

This project is part of the **Digital Logic Design** course at the University of Tehran.
