## Project Overview

This project focuses on studying the behavior of **Non-Linear Circuits** using resistive elements and diodes. The goal is to understand how non-linear components affect circuit behavior, particularly in terms of voltage-current characteristics, and to simulate these circuits using software tools.

## Key Components

### 1. Non-Linear Circuit Using Diodes
The project begins by designing a non-linear resistive circuit using diodes. The voltage-current (V-I) curve of the circuit is obtained using simulation tools.
   - Both the positive and negative voltage regions are analyzed, and the slope of the curve (which represents resistance) is calculated.

### 2. Breakdown Points in the V-I Curve
The V-I curve will show sharp changes or "breakpoints" at certain voltages. These breakpoints are identified and explained.
   - The experiment also investigates how adding a voltage source to the circuit changes the shape of the V-I curve.

### 3. Simulation and Analysis
The circuit is simulated in **Multisim** or a similar software tool, and the current and voltage at various nodes are measured.
   - A load line is added to the V-I curve to find the operating point of the circuit, and the relationship between the load line and the V-I curve is analyzed.

### 4. Comparison with Theoretical Results
The results from the simulations are compared with theoretical expectations, particularly focusing on the impact of the non-linear behavior of the diodes.
   - The differences between using regular diodes and Zener diodes are also explored by simulating circuits with different diode types and comparing their V-I curves.

## Deliverables
- Simulated V-I curves and load lines for the non-linear circuits.
- Analysis of the operating points and comparison with theoretical calculations.
- A report summarizing the behavior of non-linear circuits, including the effect of different diode types on circuit performance.

This project is part of the **Digital Logic Design** course at the University of Tehran.
