## Project Overview

This project focuses on the **Transient Responses of First-Order RC Circuits**. The main goal is to study how first-order RC circuits respond to square wave inputs of various frequencies. The time constant (τ) of the circuit, determined by the resistance and capacitance, plays a crucial role in understanding the circuit's behavior. The experiment includes both simulations and in-lab observations, comparing the results to theoretical expectations.

## Key Components

### 1. Square Wave Input Response
The experiment examines the response of RC circuits to square wave signals.
   - The time constant (τ = RC) is calculated for the circuit, and the voltage across the capacitor and resistor is measured.
   - The relationship between the period of the square wave and the time constant is analyzed to determine how the circuit behaves under different frequencies.

### 2. Exploring DC Offset
The effect of adding a DC offset to the input square wave is studied.
   - The response of the circuit with a nonzero DC offset is simulated and compared to the zero offset case.

### 3. Frequency Dependence
The experiment investigates how the circuit behaves at different frequencies. The voltage across the resistor and capacitor is analyzed for low, medium, and high-frequency square waves.
   - The concept of a "steady state" is introduced, where the circuit reaches a point where no further voltage changes occur over time.

### 4. Op-Amp Circuit
A first-order circuit with an operational amplifier (op-amp) is simulated. The experiment includes studying the op-amp’s response to square wave inputs with various duty cycles.
   - The circuit's behavior is analyzed at different frequencies, focusing on whether the circuit reaches steady state.

## Deliverables
- Simulated and observed voltage waveforms across the resistor and capacitor.
- Analysis of the time constant and its impact on circuit behavior.
- A comparison of theoretical calculations with experimental data.
- A final report discussing the transient responses of RC circuits and the influence of input frequency and DC offset.
