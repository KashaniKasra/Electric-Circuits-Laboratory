## Project Overview

This project focuses on studying the **Transient Responses of Second-Order RC Circuits**. The goal is to observe the transient behavior of these circuits under various conditions, including critically damped, underdamped, and overdamped responses. This experiment uses oscilloscopes and simulation software to compare theoretical and measured results.

## Key Components

### 1. Circuit Setup
The experiment involves setting up an **RLC series circuit** with given component values. The circuit is powered by a square wave signal generated at a fixed frequency and amplitude.
   - The response of the circuit is observed at different resistance values, using a potentiometer to vary resistance.

### 2. Underdamped, Critically Damped, and Overdamped Responses
By adjusting the resistance, the circuitâ€™s transient responses are explored, specifically looking at how the system behaves under underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped conditions.
   - Waveforms are captured using an oscilloscope, and the results are analyzed to compare the damping conditions.

### 3. Measurement and Calculation of Critical Damping
The critical damping resistance is measured, and the calculated values are compared with theoretical predictions.
   - The time constant and damping factor are also derived from the waveforms, with a comparison of theoretical and measured results.

### 4. Simulation and Data Analysis
The circuit is simulated using software to validate the results. The simulation output is compared with the experimental data to verify the accuracy of the theoretical models.
   - Additional analysis includes frequency response and phase shift measurements.

## Deliverables
- Circuit schematics and screenshots from the oscilloscope showing the transient responses for different damping conditions.
- Measurements and comparisons between theoretical and experimental data, including time constant and damping factor.
- A report discussing the transient behavior of second-order RC circuits and the accuracy of the experimental setup.

This project is part of the **Electrical Circuits Laboratory** at the University of Tehran.
