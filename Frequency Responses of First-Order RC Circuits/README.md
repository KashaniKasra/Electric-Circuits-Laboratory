## Project Overview

This project focuses on studying the **Frequency Response of First-Order RC Circuits**. The goal is to analyze how first-order RC circuits behave in terms of frequency response, including determining the cutoff frequency and bandwidth. The experiment also involves understanding the filtering behavior, amplitude, and phase response of the circuits.

## Key Components

### 1. High-Pass RC Filter
The experiment begins with constructing a high-pass RC filter using a resistor and capacitor.
   - The input is a sine wave signal generated by a function generator, and the output voltage and phase shift are measured at different frequencies.
   - Data is collected for voltage and phase differences between input and output signals, and a phase difference curve is plotted based on the calculated values.
   - The cutoff frequency is determined experimentally using an oscilloscope, and the results are compared with theoretical calculations.

### 2. Band-Pass Filter
A band-pass filter is constructed using a combination of low-pass and high-pass filters.
   - The frequency response is measured similarly to the high-pass filter, and the output amplitude and phase shift are recorded.
   - The center frequency, lower cutoff frequency, upper cutoff frequency, and bandwidth are calculated based on the collected data.

## Deliverables
- Circuit diagrams and timing diagrams.
- Experimental results and plots of amplitude and phase versus frequency.
- A final report summarizing the frequency response behavior, cutoff frequencies, and comparison with theoretical values.

This project is part of the **Digital Logic Design** course at the University of Tehran.
